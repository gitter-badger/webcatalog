## Introduction
WebCatalog Desktop is a Mac app which allows users to install and run web apps natively. It offers similar functionalities with [Fluid](http://fluidapp.com/) and [Nativefier](https://github.com/jiahaog/nativefier) but with different approach and a more user-friendly UI.

WebCatalog Desktop needs to rely on [WebCatalog Backend](https://github.com/webcatalog/backend) to store data and manage app updates.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webcatalog/desktop.git
cd desktop
yarn

To run the app for development:

To build the app:
